# Vector Space of Curves
A visual interface for creating and mixing a special class of convex curves, parameterized by pure sines of log-curvature. This parameterization has the property that a linear sum of curves yields a visually intuitive mixture of the shapes.

The curves were described and analyzed by Dongsung Huh and Terrence J. Sejnowski:
